# WIP: Spotify Rolling top 100 Playlist.

## The aim of this repo is to play around with rust (a new language for me), and also play around with the spotify API.

### The project goal is to create a spotify integration that can create a rolling top 100 playlist for a user. This will update to be the users top 100 songs of all time.
